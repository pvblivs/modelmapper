# API Overview 

The ModelMapper API consists of a few principal types:

  * **ModelMapper**
    * The class you instantiate to perform object mapping, configure matching, load PropertyMaps and register Mappers
    * Contains Configuration and TypeMaps

  * **PropertyMap**
    * The class you extend to define mappings between source and destination properties for a specific pair of types

  * **TypeMap**
    * The interface you use to perform configuration, introspection and mapping for a specific pair of types
    * Contains property mappings that are added from a PropertyMap
    * Created by a ModelMapper

  * **Converter**
    * The interface you implement to perform custom conversion between two types or property hierarchies
    * Added to a ModelMapper, set against a TypeMap, or used in a [mapping](/user-manual/property-mapping/#converters).
    
  * **Provider**
    * The interface you implement to provide instances of destination types.
    * Set against a `TypeMap` or used in a [mapping](/user-manual/property-mapping/#providers).

  * **Condition**
    * The interface you implement to conditionally create a mapping.
    * Used in a [mapping](/user-manual/property-mapping/#conditional-mapping).

Also see the [Property Mapping](/user-manual/property-mapping/) section of the User's Guide for an overview of the Mapping API.

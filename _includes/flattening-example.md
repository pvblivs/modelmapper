# Flattening

While the usage of ModelMapper to handle any object model is the same, this example demonstrates the flattening of a complex object model to a more simple model.

## Example 1

Consider the following complex object model:

```
// Assume getters and setters on each class

public class Order {
  private Customer customer;
  private Address shippingAddress;
  private Address billingAddress;
}

public class Customer {
  private String name;
}

public class Address {
  private String street;
  private String city;
}
```

We may wish to flatten `Order` to a single object:

```
public class OrderDTO {
  private String customerName;
  private String shippingStreetAddress;
  private String shippingCity;
  private String billingStreetAddress;
  private String billingCity;

  // Assume getters and setters
}
```

Assuming we have an `order` object we'd like to map to an `OrderDTO`, performing the mapping is simple:

```
ModelMapper modelMapper = new ModelMapper();
OrderDTO dto = modelMapper.map(order, OrderDTO.class);
```

We can assert that the values were mapped as expected:
```
assert dto.getCustomerName().equals(order.getCustomer().getName());
assert dto.getShippingStreetAddress().equals(order.getShippingAddress().getStreet());
assert dto.getShippingCity().equals(order.getShippingAddress().getCity());
assert dto.getBillingStreetAddress().equals(order.getBillingAddress().getStreet());
assert dto.getBillingCity().equals(order.getBillingAddress().getCity());
```

## Example 2

Consider the following source object model:

```
// Assume getters and setters on each class

public class Person {
  private Address address;
}

public class Address {
  private String street;
  private String city;
}
```

We may wish to flatten `Person` to the following object:

```
public class PersonDTO {
  private String street;
  private String city;

  // Assume getters and setters
}
```

With the default (Standard) [MatchingStrategies matching strategy], `Person.address.street` will not match `PersonDTO.street` and `Person.address.city` will not match `PersonDTO.city` since the expected `address` token is not present on the destination side. To solve this we have two options:

### Option 1: Create a PropertyMap

A PropertyMap allows us to create explicit mappings for `street` and `city` between the source and destination types:

```
PropertyMap<Person, PersonDTO> personMap = new PropertyMap<Person, PersonDTO>() {
  protected void configure() {
    map().setStreet(source.getAddress().getStreet());
    map().setCity(source.getAddress().getCity());
  }
};

modelMapper.addMappings(personMap);
```

### Option 2: Use the Loose Matching Strategy

While the default Standard [MatchingStrategies matching strategy] will not match source and destination properties that are missing a name token, the Loose matching strategy will match properties so long as the _last_ destination property name in the hierarchy is matched. In this case the last destination property name tokens are `street` and `city` which we can expect a match for since they are present on the source side.

Configuring the Loose matching strategy to be used is simple:

```
modelMapper.getConfiguration().setMatchingStrategy(MatchingStrategies.LOOSE);
```

### Result

After loading a PropertyMap or setting the Loose matching strategy, we can perform the map operation and assert that our results are as expected:

```
PersonDTO dto = modelMapper.map(person, PersonDTO.class);

assert dto.getStreet().equals(person.getAddress().getStreet());
assert dto.getCity().equals(person.getAddress().getCity());
```
